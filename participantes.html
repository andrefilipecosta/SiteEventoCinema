    <h3>Christian Barani</h3>
    <p>
      Is building a practice that combines documentary and visual arts. The filmmaking process involves an experience involving a body/camera walking through space. To film, he defines a set of rules that incorporate chance and improvisation. There is no pre-script; walking is used as an invitation to encounter. Everything is played out in the moment. At the end of the experience, material is collected; it will take different forms depending on the upcoming project and the exhibition venue: film, installation, performance, etc.
